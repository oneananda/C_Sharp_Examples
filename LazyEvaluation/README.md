# Lazy evaluation 

### Lazy evaluation is a technique where an expression is not evaluated until its value is actually needed. C# provides this feature through the Lazy<T> type. It's used to defer the initialization of a resource until it is actually accessed, helping improve performance and avoid unnecessary computations.

## Overview

Implicit conversions in C# allow certain types to be converted to other types without explicit casting. This feature is useful for ensuring type safety and simplifying code. This project provides examples of implicit conversions, including numeric type conversions, class inheritance, and custom conversion operators.

## Basic Examples

**Implicit Conversion Between Numeric Types**

- Converting a smaller numeric type to a larger numeric type (e.g., `int` to `double`).
- Converting int to long
- Converting from bigger memory size to smaller one (will not compile/work)

## Medium Examples

**Implicit Conversion Between Classes**

Converting from a derived class to a base class.

## Advanced Examples

**Custom Implicit Conversion Operators**

Creating a custom implicit conversion between two user-defined types.

# Lazy Initialization Vs Dependency Injection

## Introduction

Here we are going to see the key differences between Lazy Initialization and Dependency Injection which may sound similiar, but infact not, both the SW design concepts are distinct by nature, we will see this with examples

## Lazy Initialization

Lazy Initialization is used to delay the object creation process until it is actually needed,

This can improve the performance of the application, we can acheive this by using Lazy<T> class which ensures the object is created when it is accessed for first time

## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that helps to decouple the creation of objects from it's usage, In DI, objects are passed their dependencies rather than creating them internally

This improves  

- Testability, 
- Maintainability, 
- Flexibility

DI is commonly implemented using an IoC (Inversion of Control) container, which manages the lifecycle of the objects

## DI Analogy

Imagine you are running a restaurant, you tasked the chef to prepare the meal as well as bring ingredients from store whenever any order comes up, this is without DI,

Now with DI, you asked the chef to do only to prepare the meal, and provide the ingredients whevener needed by restaurant or other person (here we call it DI container)

In this analogy:

Restaurant: DI container
Chef: Your application or service
Ingredients: Dependencies (services)
Customer’s Order: Request for a service

## Use Case for Dependency Injection (DI)

Scenario: You have an application with multiple components that depend on various services, such as a logging service, database access, and configuration management.

Use Case: DI helps in injecting these dependencies into your components, making the code modular and easier to test. For example, you can inject a mock logging service for unit tests without changing the actual implementation.

## Lazy Initialization Analogy

Imagine you have a book that you only want to read if you have free time. Instead of carrying it around all day, you keep it on the shelf and only take it out when you decide to read it. This is like Lazy Initialization in programming.

## Use Cases for Lazy Initialization

Scenario: You have a service or object that is costly to create (e.g., due to heavy computation, large memory usage, or network calls).

Use Case: Use Lazy Initialization to defer the creation of this object until it is actually needed, thus avoiding the overhead of creating it upfront if it may not be used.

# Lazy Initialization Vs Dependency Injection

## Introduction

In software designing one can easily get deceived with the two concepts as one, Lazy Initialization and Dependency Injection

Here we are going to see the key differences between Lazy Initialization and Dependency Injection which may sound similiar, but infact not, both the SW design concepts are distinct by nature, we will see this with examples

## Lazy Initialization

Lazy Initialization is used to delay the object creation process until it is actually needed,

This can improve the performance of the application, we can acheive this by using Lazy<T> class which ensures the object is created when it is accessed for first time

## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that helps to decouple the creation of objects from it's usage, In DI, objects are passed their dependencies rather than creating them internally

This improves  

- Testability, 
- Maintainability, 
- Flexibility

DI is commonly implemented using an IoC (Inversion of Control) container, which manages the lifecycle of the objects

## DI Analogy

- Imagine you are running a restaurant, you tasked the chef to prepare the meal as well as bring ingredients from store whenever any order comes up, this is without DI,

- Now with DI, you asked the chef to do only to prepare the meal, and provide the ingredients whevener needed by restaurant or other person (here we call it DI container)

`In this analogy`

- **Restaurant**: DI container
- **Chef**: Your application or service
- **Ingredients**: Dependencies (services)
- **Customer’s Order**: Request for a service

### Why Use DI?

**Efficiency**: The restaurant handles all the ingredient logistics, allowing the chef to focus on cooking. Similarly, DI handles the creation and management of dependencies, allowing your code to focus on its main tasks.

**Flexibility**: If you want to change the ingredients or add new ones (like changing a service), you do so in one place (the restaurant), and it automatically affects all meals (components) that need those ingredients.

### Use Case for Dependency Injection (DI)

Scenario: You have an application with multiple components that depend on various services, such as a logging service, database access, and configuration management.

Use Case: DI helps in injecting these dependencies into your components, making the code modular and easier to test. For example, you can inject a mock logging service for unit tests without changing the actual implementation.

## Lazy Initialization Analogy

Imagine you have a book that you only want to read if you have free time. Instead of carrying it around all day, you keep it on the shelf and only take it out when you decide to read it. This is like Lazy Initialization in programming.


### How Lazy Initialization Works: 

Without Lazy Initialization: The book (object or resource) is taken out and put on the table as soon as you start your day, even if you might not use it.

With Lazy Initialization: The book stays on the shelf until you actually decide to read it. This saves you from carrying it around unnecessarily.

### Why Use Lazy Initialization?

Saves Resources: If creating the book (object) is expensive or time-consuming, you only do it when needed, saving time and resources.

Improves Performance: You avoid the overhead of setting up something that might not be used right away.

### Use Cases for Lazy Initialization

Scenario: You have a service or object that is costly to create (e.g., due to heavy computation, large memory usage, or network calls).

Use Case: Use Lazy Initialization to defer the creation of this object until it is actually needed, thus avoiding the overhead of creating it upfront if it may not be used.


## Q & A

Imagine you have a complex service that takes a long time to initialize. Would it be better to register this service as Singleton and use Lazy Initialization, or should it be registered as Transient? What are the trade-offs?

For a complex service that takes a long time to initialize, registering it as a Singleton and using Lazy Initialization is often a better approach. This setup ensures that the service is created only once, improving performance by avoiding repeated expensive initializations. Lazy Initialization delays the creation until the service is actually needed, which optimizes resource usage. On the other hand, registering the service as Transient means a new instance is created every time it is requested, which can be inefficient for complex services. The trade-off with Singleton and Lazy Initialization is that while you save on initialization time, you must manage potential issues related to long-lived instances, such as resource management and state consistency.

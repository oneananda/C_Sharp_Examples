# Task Parallel Library (TPL) in C#

The **Task Parallel Library (TPL)** is a powerful framework in .NET for writing parallel and asynchronous code efficiently. It provides high-level abstractions to execute tasks concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness.

## 🚀 What is TPL?
TPL is part of the **System.Threading.Tasks** namespace and simplifies multithreading by handling thread scheduling, synchronization, and resource management automatically.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Task-based programming** (`Task`, `Task<T>`)
- **Parallel execution** (`Parallel.For`, `Parallel.ForEach`)
- **Task continuation** (`ContinueWith`)
- **Cancellation support** (`CancellationToken`)
- **Exception handling** (`AggregateException`)

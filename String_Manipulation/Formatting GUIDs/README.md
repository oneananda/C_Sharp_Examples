# Formatting GUIDs in C#

This repository provides an overview of various ways to format GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) in C#. GUIDs are 128-bit integers used to uniquely identify information in computer systems. The `ToString()` method in C# can format GUIDs in different ways to suit various needs.

## Overview

The repository covers the following formatting options for GUIDs:

1. **Default Format**
    - Demonstrates the default behavior of the `ToString()` method, which outputs GUIDs with hyphens and braces.

2. **No Braces, No Hyphens (`N` Format)**
    - Shows how to format GUIDs as 32 digits without any separators.

3. **Hyphens Only (`D` Format)**
    - Illustrates how to format GUIDs with hyphens but without braces.

4. **Braces (`B` Format)**
    - Explains how to format GUIDs with both braces and hyphens.

5. **Parentheses (`P` Format)**

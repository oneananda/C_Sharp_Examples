# Advanced SOLID Patterns Implementation

Welcome to the Advanced SOLID Patterns Implementation project! This repository is dedicated to providing comprehensive examples and explanations of the SOLID principles in software design, showcasing advanced usage and implementation patterns.

## Overview

The SOLID principles are a set of design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles are:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

This project aims to demonstrate how these principles can be implemented in real-world scenarios using advanced patterns and techniques.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### Explanation

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility. This principle helps to reduce the complexity of the code and makes it easier to maintain and understand.

### Example

In this example, we will demonstrate SRP by separating the responsibilities of a `User` class and a `UserService` class.

#### Before Applying SRP

```csharp
public class Before_SRP_User
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }

    public void Save()
    {
        // Code to save the user to a database
    }

    public void SendEmail()
    {
        // Code to send an email
    }
}
```

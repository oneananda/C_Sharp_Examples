# MediatR Console Application

This is a simple console application demonstrating the use of [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR), a library for implementing the Mediator pattern in .NET. The application shows how to use MediatR to handle requests and responses in a .NET console application.

## Features

- **Request/Response Model**: Enables communication between components using a request/response pattern.
- **Command/Query Separation**: Separates commands that change state from queries that return data.
- **Decoupling**: Decouples components in the application, promoting a cleaner architecture.
- **Pipeline Behaviors**: Allows for execution of cross-cutting concerns such as logging and validation.

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK installed on your machine.
- NuGet package manager for managing dependencies.

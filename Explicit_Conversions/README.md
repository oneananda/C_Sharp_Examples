# Basic Explicit Conversions in C#

This repository contains examples and explanations of basic explicit conversions in C#. Explicit conversions are used when you need to convert a value from one data type to another and there’s a possibility that the conversion might not succeed or might lose information. These conversions require a cast operator.

## Overview

Explicit conversions in C# involve converting one data type to another using a cast operator. This is necessary in situations where implicit conversion is not possible, usually due to potential data loss or conversion failure. Common scenarios include converting between numeric types and converting between custom types.

## Examples Covered

- Converting `double` to `int`
- Converting `float` to `int`
- Converting `long` to `int`
- Converting `decimal` to `int`
- Converting `string` to `int` using `Parse` and `TryParse`
- Converting `object` to a specific type

## Usage

Each example in this repository demonstrates a specific type of explicit conversion. To run these examples, clone the repository and open the solution in your preferred IDE (such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code).

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (latest version recommended)
- An IDE or text editor that supports C# (such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code)

### Running the Examples

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/oneananda/C_Sharp_Examples.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd C_Sharp_Examples
    ```

3. Open the solution in your IDE and run the examples.
